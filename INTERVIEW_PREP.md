# Auction System Interview Prep Sheet

This sheet covers potential interview questions related to the Auction System project, focusing on design, implementation, and best practices.


## General Project Questions
**Q: What is the Auction System? Describe its main features and user roles.**
A: The Auction System is a web application that allows users to buy and sell products via online auctions. There are three user roles: Admin (manages users and approves products), Seller (lists products for auction), and Buyer (places bids on products). Key features include product approval, bidding, user management, and auction scheduling.

**Q: Which technologies and frameworks are used in this project?**
A: The backend uses Spring Boot (Java), Spring Data JPA for ORM, and MySQL for the database. The frontend uses Thymeleaf templates and Bootstrap for styling. Maven is used for build automation.

**Q: How does the user authentication and authorization work?**
A: Authentication is session-based, with passwords hashed using BCrypt. Authorization is role-based, restricting access to routes and features based on user roles (Admin, Seller, Buyer).

**Q: How is the project structured (package/module structure)?**
A: The code is organized into packages: `controller` (web endpoints), `service` (business logic), `repository` (data access), `entity` (JPA entities), and `config` (configuration classes).


## Backend (Spring Boot, Java)
**Q: How does Spring Boot simplify application development?**
A: Spring Boot provides auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features, reducing boilerplate and setup time for Java web applications.

**Q: What is the role of Spring Data JPA in this project?**
A: Spring Data JPA handles ORM, allowing easy CRUD operations and query methods for entities like User, Product, and Bid without writing SQL.

**Q: How are entities, repositories, and services organized?**
A: Entities represent database tables, repositories provide data access methods, and services contain business logic. Controllers use services to process requests.

**Q: How is dependency injection used in the project?**
A: Spring's `@Autowired` annotation injects dependencies (services, repositories) into classes, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

**Q: How are scheduled tasks or background jobs handled (if any)?**
A: Scheduled tasks can be implemented using Spring's `@Scheduled` annotation. (If not used, mention: No scheduled tasks are currently implemented.)

**Q: How is exception handling managed?**
A: Exception handling is managed using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` to provide user-friendly error messages and handle errors globally.


## Database & Persistence
**Q: How is the database schema designed? Name the main tables and their relationships.**
A: The main tables are `users` (user info and roles), `products` (auction items, linked to sellers), and `bids` (bid records, linked to buyers and products). Relationships are managed via JPA annotations.

**Q: How are transactions managed?**
A: Spring manages transactions automatically for repository methods. For complex operations, `@Transactional` is used to ensure atomicity.

**Q: How is data validation performed?**
A: Data validation is handled using JSR-303 annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`) in entity classes and validated in controllers.

**Q: How is password security implemented?**
A: Passwords are hashed using BCrypt before storage. Plain text passwords are never stored in the database.

**Q: How are database migrations or schema updates handled?**
A: Schema updates are managed by JPA's `ddl-auto: update` setting. For production, tools like Flyway or Liquibase are recommended.


## Security
**Q: How are passwords stored and validated?**
A: Passwords are hashed with BCrypt and validated by comparing the hash during login.

**Q: What is BCrypt and why is it used?**
A: BCrypt is a password-hashing function that adds salt and is computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks harder.

**Q: How is role-based access control implemented?**
A: User roles are stored in the database and checked in controllers/services to restrict access to certain endpoints.

**Q: How are sessions managed?**
A: Sessions are managed by Spring Security, which tracks authenticated users and their roles.

**Q: How are user accounts created and approved?**
A: Users register via a form. Sellers' products require admin approval before being listed for auction.


## Frontend (Thymeleaf, Bootstrap)
**Q: How does Thymeleaf integrate with Spring Boot?**
A: Thymeleaf templates are rendered by Spring controllers, allowing dynamic content and form handling.

**Q: How are templates organized for different user roles?**
A: Templates are grouped in folders by role (admin, seller, buyer) for clear separation and access control.

**Q: How is form validation handled on the frontend?**
A: HTML5 validation attributes and Thymeleaf error messages are used to provide instant feedback.

**Q: How is user feedback (success/error messages) displayed?**
A: Feedback is shown using Thymeleaf conditionals and Bootstrap alert components.


## Application Deployment & Configuration
**Q: How do you configure the application for different environments (dev, prod, test)?**
A: Separate configuration files (e.g., `application-prod.yml`, `application-test.properties`) are used for different environments.

**Q: How is the application started and stopped?**
A: The app is started with `mvn spring-boot:run` or `java -jar target/*.jar` and stopped by terminating the process.

**Q: How do you handle environment variables and secrets?**
A: Sensitive data like DB credentials are stored in environment variables or external config files, not hardcoded.

**Q: How would you deploy this application to a cloud provider?**
A: The app can be containerized with Docker and deployed to platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku. Environment-specific configs are provided at deployment.


## Testing
**Q: What types of tests are included (unit, integration, etc.)?**
A: The project can include unit tests for services and integration tests for controllers and repositories.

**Q: How do you test controllers and services?**
A: Controllers are tested using Spring's MockMvc, and services are tested with JUnit and Mockito.

**Q: How do you mock dependencies in tests?**
A: Mockito is used to mock repositories and services, allowing isolated unit tests.


## Troubleshooting & Debugging
**Q: What are common issues you faced and how did you resolve them?**
A: Common issues include database connection errors (fixed by checking credentials and DB status) and port conflicts (resolved by changing the server port).

**Q: How do you debug a failing build or a runtime error?**
A: By reading stack traces, using logs, and running the app in debug mode to inspect variables and flow.


## Advanced / Open-Ended
**Q: How would you add real-time bidding?**
A: Use WebSockets (Spring WebSocket or STOMP) to push live bid updates to clients without page reloads.

**Q: How would you implement email notifications?**
A: Integrate with JavaMailSender or a third-party service (e.g., SendGrid) to send emails on auction events.

**Q: How would you scale the application for more users?**
A: Use load balancers, optimize database queries, cache frequently accessed data, and deploy multiple app instances.

**Q: How would you secure the REST API if you added one?**
A: Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication, HTTPS for transport security, and validate all inputs.
